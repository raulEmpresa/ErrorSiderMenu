🛠️ Misalignment Issue with Custom Icons in Ant Design Layout <br>
📌 Issue Description <br>
When using the Layout component from Ant Design, we encountered a misalignment issue with custom size icons. While Ant Design's built-in icons align correctly within the Sider component, if we put a custom size the icon appear slightly misaligned. <br>

The icon in nav1 is from ant design and it is centered.

However, in this case, the icon has a custom size, and it appears misaligned.

I have tried everything possible but could not find a solution.
